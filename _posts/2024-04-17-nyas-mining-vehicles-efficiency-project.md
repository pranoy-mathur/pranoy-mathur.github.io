My latest project as part of the New York Academy of Sciences was to design an innovative approach to secure the supply of critical minerals in the transition to a fossil-free society. Read more...

My group and I decided to work on the efficiency of mining vehicles that release vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. During our research, we discovered the methods through which carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere, as a result of mining activities, could be captured. However, it was imperative we found a technique to either store or harness the carbon dioxide, and we chose the latter. 

Our project utilized “Metal Organic Frameworks”, a porous polymer that essentially acts as a sponge (with a large surface area) to absorb carbon dioxide. This form of carbon capture technology would allow us to store the gas emissions, from where it could be used productively later on.

The MOF model we used was MOF-74, which has the highest carbon dioxide capturing potential of any other porous substance. The figure above (credit: Promethean Particles) depicts the inner workings of the MOF. 

The MOF had two distinct chambers joined by a pipe at the top. The carbon dioxide enters the structure via the inlet on the left and is cooled down, making it denser, and thus making it pass through the connecting pipe (supposed to connect the bottom of the two chambers). It then enters the second chamber, where the MOF is present. The MOF will absorb the carbon dioxide until it is required later, where it will be heated to make the MOF, thus desorbing the carbon dioxide. Thus, the problem of the storing of carbon dioxide was resolved.

After some more research, we figured out that dissolving carbon dioxide in water forms carbonic acid, which can be used to break down many types of rocks. If this was used correctly, it would make it easier for mining vehicles to break through layers of rocks due to their weakened structures, thus lowering the costs and energy required by mining vehicles. 

Therefore, we implemented another piece of technology after the carbon dioxide was stored in the MOFs, which would pressurize the carbon dioxide into liquid state and dissolve it in water, forming carbonic acid, which could be injected into the rocks being mined by the vehicles.

Thus, our project was complete and due to all our efforts, we won “Team of Distinction”.
