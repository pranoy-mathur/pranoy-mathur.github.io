Preparing tasty chicken rolls in only half an hour! Read more...

A week ago, our house was left devoid of any person able to cook dinner for my brother and me. Rather than ordering fast food in, I hurried to the kitchen to find beautiful cuts of chicken breast lying serenely in the freezer. It seemed a shame to order from a restaurant and let the chicken go unused. Thus, my 2020 lockdown self came alive, and decided to cook some tasty chicken rolls, oozing with flavor. Fortunately, it only takes 30 minutes to cook, and is relatively healthy with high amounts of protein and minimal fat.

(I donâ€™t have precise measurements for the recipe since it was a hastily prepared dinner, so feel free to estimate based on your judgment and preferences.)

Ingredients:
- Chicken breast (or any other boneless cuts)
- Capsicum
- Onion
- Soy Sauce
- Honey
- Garlic
- Sriracha (or any other hot sauce)
- Tortilla

Recipe:
- Soak the chicken breast in saline water for around 1-2 hours before you start cooking. _[This makes the chicken breast more moist after cooking. Water moves from the saline solution into the chicken breast via osmosis (the movement of water molecules from an area of higher water molecule concentration, in the solution, to an area of lower water molecule concentration, in the chicken)]_.
- To prepare your marinade, combine soy sauce, honey and sriracha in an approximately 2:1:1 ratio. Add plenty of diced or minced garlic to the mixture. You can taste it and adjust the flavors to your liking, depending on whether you want it sweeter or more umami. The marinade should ideally be a bit more than enough to coat all of the chicken pieces you have added.
- Cut the chicken into thin strips, about the size of your pinky finger, and add it to the marinade _[You want to ensure the chicken strips are small so the chicken has a larger surface area to absorb all the tasty marinade]_. You can let the chicken swim in this mixture overnight if you wish, to ensure the chicken soaks up all of the flavor, but you can cook it immediately if you wish.
- Cut your onions and capsicum into thin strips, and in a pan (I used a grill pan), sautee them with salt and any other seasoning (chili powder, garlic powder etc), until brown. Set them aside
- To the same pan add a bit of olive oil and the marinated chicken. Let it sear at a high heat, turning occasionally until it develops a char (be careful not to overcook it, otherwise it will turn out dry and rubbery). _[The honey in the marinate contains sugars, such as glucose, that caramelize, giving your chicken a beautiful char.]_
- Warm your tortilla, add your chicken and vegetable mixture, and enjoy with a squeeze of lemon or your favorite condiment!
